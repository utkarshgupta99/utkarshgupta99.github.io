Welcome to my website!
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) at Northeastern University, Boston. I am advised by [Prof. Hessam Mahdavifar]([https://roseyu.com/](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=mZMaDgEAAAAJ&hl=en)). My research interests include spatio-temporal modeling and causal inference.

In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Sivananthan Sampath](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~siva/) on the conjugate gradient method with general source conditions, [Prof. Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/) and [Prof. Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) (then Ph.D. candidate) on Multi-Agent Path-Finding, [Prof. Srikanta Bedathur](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/) and [Prof. Amitabha Bagchi](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~bagchi/) on Fast One-Class Classifiers, and [Prof. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0) on Domain Generalization. Find my CV [here](https://github.com/VSumanth99/VSumanth99.github.io/raw/master/files/Sumanth_Varambally_CV.pdf) (updated November, 2023).

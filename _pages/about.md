======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) at Northeastern University, Boston. I am advised by [Prof. Hessam Mahdavifar]([https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=mZMaDgEAAAAJ&hl=en]). My research interests lie at the intersection of privacy, security, and information theory.

Before moving to Northeastern University with my advisor, I was a PhD Candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, from where I also received a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. 

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 2017, with a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing. I have worked with [Prof. Amitabha Tripahi](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~atripath/) on characterizing numerical semigroups for linear recurrences, and , [Prof. Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/) and [Prof. Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) (then Ph.D. candidate) on Multi-Agent Path-Finding, [Prof. Srikanta Bedathur](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/) and [Prof. Amitabha Bagchi](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~bagchi/) on Fast One-Class Classifiers, and [Prof. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0) on Domain Generalization.
